# k12-funding-on-socioeconomics

## Project notes
We're looking to investigate the relationship between school funding and the socioeconomic status in the United States. We'll examine factors such as tax revenue, median household income, and poverty rates.

## Data Sets
The Elementary/Secondary Information System (ElSi) contains finance data, including revenues and expenditures for public elementary and secondary education: https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/

The Census Bureau offers several datasets that can provide information on socioeconomic factors such as median household income and poverty rates. The American Community Survey (ACS) is an excellent resource for this type of data: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html
